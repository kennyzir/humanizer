---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Content Marketing at Scale
**Problem**: Your team uses AI to draft blog posts, but they all sound the same

**Solution**:
1. Generate draft with ChatGPT/Claude
2. Run through humanizer to remove AI patterns
3. Get authentic brand voice
4. Publish with confidence

**Example**:
```typescript
const draft = await chatgpt.complete(blogPrompt);
const humanized = await claw0x.call('humanizer', { text: draft });
await cms.publish(humanized.humanized_text);
// Result: 80% faster content production, passes AI detection
```

### Scenario 2: Email Campaigns
**Problem**: AI-generated emails feel impersonal and get low engagement

**Solution**:
1. Generate email variants with AI
2. Humanize to add personality
3. A/B test humanized vs. original
4. See 2-3x higher open rates

**Example**:
```python
for variant in email_variants:
    humanized = client.call("humanizer", {"text": variant})
    campaign.add_variant(humanized["humanized_text"])
# Result: Humanized emails get 2.5x more replies
```

### Scenario 3: Academic Writing
**Problem**: Students use AI for drafts but get flagged by detection tools

**Solution**:
1. Write initial draft with AI assistance
2. Humanize to remove telltale patterns
3. Add personal insights and examples
4. Pass plagiarism and AI detection checks

**Example**:
```javascript
const essayDraft = await ai.generateEssay(topic);
const humanized = await humanizer.process(essayDraft);
// Result: Passes GPTZero, Originality.ai, Turnitin AI detection
```

### Scenario 4: Documentation Cleanup
**Problem**: Technical docs generated by AI are full of filler phrases

**Solution**:
1. Generate docs from code comments
2. Humanize to remove "Additionally", "It is worth noting"
3. Get clear, direct documentation
4. Improve developer experience

**Example**:
```bash
# Batch process all docs
for file in docs/*.md; do
  curl -X POST https://api.claw0x.com/v1/call \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAW0X_API_KEY" \
    -d "{\"skill\":\"humanizer\",\"input\":{\"text\":\"$(cat $file)\"}}" \
    | jq -r '.humanized_text' > $file
done
# Result: 40% shorter docs, 60% fewer support questions
```

## Integration Recipes

### OpenClaw Agent
```typescript
import { Claw0xClient } from '@claw0x/sdk';

const claw0x = new Claw0xClient(process.env.CLAW0X_API_KEY);

// Humanize agent responses before showing to user
agent.onResponse(async (response) => {
  const result = await claw0x.call('humanizer', {
    text: response.content
  });
  
  return result.humanized_text;
});
```

### LangChain Agent
```python
from claw0x import Claw0xClient
import os

client = Claw0xClient(api_key=os.getenv("CLAW0X_API_KEY"))

def humanize_output(ai_text):
    result = client.call("humanizer", {
        "text": ai_text
    })
    return result["humanized_text"]

# Use in chain
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm) | humanize_output
```

### Content Pipeline (Generic HTTP)
```javascript
async function publishBlogPost(topic) {
  // Generate draft
  const draft = await openai.complete({
    prompt: `Write a blog post about ${topic}`
  });
  
  // Humanize
  const response = await fetch('https://api.claw0x.com/v1/call', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.CLAW0X_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      skill: 'humanizer',
      input: { text: draft }
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  // Publish
  await cms.create({
    title: topic,
    content: result.humanized_text,
    status: 'published'
  });
}
```

### Batch Processing
```typescript
// Humanize multiple documents
const documents = await db.drafts.findMany({ status: 'ai-generated' });

const humanized = await Promise.all(
  documents.map(doc => 
    claw0x.call('humanizer', { text: doc.content })
  )
);

// Update database
for (let i = 0; i < documents.length; i++) {
  await db.drafts.update({
    where: { id: documents[i].id },
    data: { 
      content: humanized[i].humanized_text,
      status: 'humanized'
    }
  });
}
```

## How It Works — Under the Hood

This skill uses a two-layer architecture to transform AI-generated text into human-sounding prose:

### Layer 1: LLM Rewriting (Primary)

The primary path sends your text to a large language model (currently Gemini) with a carefully engineered system prompt derived from Wikipedia's [WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup) guide. The system prompt instructs the model to:

1. **Scan** the input for all 24 known AI writing patterns (see full list below)
2. **Rewrite** the text to eliminate those patterns while preserving meaning
3. **Audit** the rewritten output for any lingering AI-isms
4. **Revise** a second time to catch patterns that survived the first pass

The LLM is also given personality rules — have opinions, vary sentence rhythm, acknowledge complexity, use "I" when natural, and let some structural imperfection through. Perfect structure is itself an AI signal.

### Layer 2: Regex Fallback (Deterministic)

If the LLM is unavailable (API key missing, rate limit, timeout), the skill falls back to a deterministic regex engine that applies pattern-matched replacements across six categories:

- **Chatbot artifacts** — removes "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if...", "Great question!"
- **Filler phrases** — "in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because"
- **Significance inflation** — "marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of" → removed
- **Copula avoidance** — "serves as" → "is", "functions as" → "is"
- **AI vocabulary** — 40+ word substitutions (e.g. "leverage" → "use", "facilitate" → "help")
- **Emoji removal** and em-dash normalization

The regex path is lower quality but instant, deterministic, and zero-cost.

### The 24 AI Writing Patterns Targeted

These are the specific signals this skill detects and removes, organized by category:

**Content patterns:**
1. Significance inflation ("pivotal moment", "testament to")
2. Notability name-dropping (listing media outlets without context)
3. Superficial -ing analyses ("highlighting...", "showcasing...")
4. Promotional language ("nestled", "vibrant", "groundbreaking")
5. Vague attributions ("Experts believe", "Industry reports suggest")
6. Formulaic resilience ("Despite challenges... continues to thrive")

**Language patterns:**
7. AI vocabulary (additionally, delve, landscape, tapestry, underscore, foster, garner, showcase, testament, pivotal, crucial, enhance, interplay, intricate)
8. Copula avoidance ("serves as" instead of "is", "boasts" instead of "has")
9. Negative parallelisms ("It's not just X, it's Y")
10. Rule of three overuse
11. Synonym cycling (protagonist/main character/central figure/hero)
12. False ranges ("from X to Y, from A to B")

**Style patterns:**
13. Em dash overuse → replaced with commas/periods
14. Boldface overuse → removed
15. Inline-header lists → converted to prose
16. Title Case Headings → sentence case
17. Emojis → removed
18. Curly quotes → straight quotes

**Communication patterns:**
19. Chatbot artifacts ("I hope this helps!", "Let me know if...")
20. Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers ("While details are limited...")
21. Sycophantic tone ("Great question!", "You're absolutely right!")

**Filler patterns:**
22. Filler phrases ("In order to" → "To", "Due to the fact that" → "Because")
23. Excessive hedging ("could potentially possibly" → "may")
24. Generic conclusions ("The future looks bright")

## Why This Approach Works

Most "AI humanizer" tools simply paraphrase text or add random typos. This skill takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **Pattern-specific targeting** — instead of blindly rewriting, it identifies and removes the exact linguistic fingerprints that AI detection tools look for
- **Wikipedia-sourced taxonomy** — the 24 patterns come from the Wikipedia community's real-world experience cleaning up AI-generated encyclopedia articles, not from guesswork
- **Two-pass audit** — the LLM rewrites once, then audits its own output for surviving patterns, catching things a single pass would miss
- **Personality injection** — the system prompt explicitly tells the model to have opinions, vary rhythm, and allow imperfection, because real human writing is messy
